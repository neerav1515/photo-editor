This is a basic photo editor using image processing .

Can perform basic operations on an image (will be updating more functionalties with time).

Functionalties like rotate, flip etc. are implemented from scratch at pixel level

Resizing done with the help of sampling technique.

Formula used for greyscaling has been picked form an article on stack overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6615002/given-an-rgb-value-how-do-i-create-a-tint-or-shade#:~:text=For%20shades%2C%20multiply%20each%20component,%2C%203%2F4%2C%20etc.)
